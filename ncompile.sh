#!/usr/bin/env bash
## Usage instructions:
## yum/apt-get install git
## git clone https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver
## cd forgottenserver
## bash ncompile.sh
## It is important to run with 'bash' and not 'sh' or as an executable(./file)
## because the script is multi-platform so I did not include the shebang
## and old shell does not support a few things I did here

## Script by dominique120
## Few edits and fixes by fallen(decltype)
## Idea from the compile.sh script that was packed with some TFS 0.4 revs.
## Made for TFS 1.0
## If you plan of editing try to keep the structure and conventions
## Line endings must be LF only, not CRLF.

## TODO:
## Add other operating systems (MacOSX, Arch Linux)
## Test the multicore build section 
## Add other optimizations to the make process (maybe use ccache?)

## Get CPU core count
## Still testing
cpuCores=$(nproc)
## make processes to be spawned.
coreBuild=$((cpuCores + 1))

## Colors
greenText=$(tput setab 0; tput setaf 2)
redText=$(tput setab 0; tput setaf 1)
blueText=$(tput setab 0; tput setaf 6)
none=$(tput sgr0)

## Notes
# 1: SL6 and CentOS latest version of CMAKE is 2.6.4 as of 1/7/2014(us), thus incompatible with TFS 1.0 building process. It must be manually added, tutorial below:
# https://github.com/jackywei/HOW-TO-BUILD-HHVM-WiKi/wiki/Build-&-Install-CMake-2.8.10.2-in-CentOS6.3
# And look at issue #391 for more details about old packages in SL6 and CentOS
